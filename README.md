## 🎨 Customization Guide

### Changing Colors

The color scheme is defined through CSS variables in the `:root` selector at the top of `assets/css/styles.css`. Update these to change the site's color scheme:

```css
:root {
    --primary: #5468ff;          /* Primary brand color */
    --primary-light: #7d8bff;    /* Lighter version of primary */
    --primary-dark: #3a4eef;     /* Darker version of primary */
    /* ...other colors... */
}
```

### Replacing Images

1. Place your own images in the `/assets/images/` directory
2. Update the image paths in `index.html` 

### Changing Content

Update the content in `index.html`. The structure is semantic and clearly labeled with comments to make it easy to identify sections.

### Modifying Psychological Triggers

The advanced psychological elements are primarily in `scripts.js`. Look for the section labeled "Advanced Psychological Hook: Behavior Tracking" to adjust how the page responds to user behavior.

## 📱 Responsive Behavior

The site uses a mobile-first design approach with responsive breakpoints at:
- 1200px (large desktops)
- 992px (desktops and laptops)
- 768px (tablets)
- 576px (phones)

## 🧠 The Psychology Behind the Framework

The SocialTriggers Framework implements six core psychological triggers that drive engagement:

1. **Cognitive Dissonance Activation** - Creating information gaps that the brain is neurologically compelled to resolve
2. **Identity Reinforcement Patterns** - Formulations that allow multiple audience segments to validate their worldviews 
3. **Algorithmic Resonance Mapping** - Leveraging the specific engagement patterns that algorithms reward
4. **Precision Communication Architecture** - Scientifically-optimized frameworks for maximum resonance
5. **Sustained Engagement Loops** - Creating self-reinforcing information ecosystems for continued relevance 
6. **Authority Positioning Framework** - Psychology-based techniques for establishing contextual expertise
